<h1 id="introduction">What is Dogecoin</h1>

<p>Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin and Litecoin. While that sounds all very complicated, Dogecoin is here to make it simple and fun. It is based on the doge (say: "dohj") meme which revolves around a cute Shiba Inu, but it is grown to something huge. In less than a month it's grown larger than most other currencies (many of which have existed for multiple years!) and already it has great apps (such as an Android wallet), you can buy things with it. Why? Because it's fun!</p>

<h2>What is cryptocurrency</h2>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are currencies that exist only digitally. They are generated by mining them, which basically means having a computer program solve complex mathematical equations. Any computer can participate, but the more powerful it is, the faster it will go (and the more coins you will get!).</p>
<p>You manage the coins you have in a wallet, which can be stored on various locations (usually on your PC, but also on your phone or a paper wallet). You can use these currencies like you use digital money, so basically just to transfer them to other people. As you can imagine, the adoption of any currency depends on what you can buy with them and how many people will accept it!</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies have become quite popular with Bitcoin getting more mainstream attention due to its recent rising in value. There now exist a huge number of so called altcoins, which is a collective name for all coins that are not Bitcoins, so basically "alternative coins". Dogecoin is such an alternative coin, and a big one at that!</p>
